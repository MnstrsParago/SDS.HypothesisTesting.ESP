# E-Commerce Sales & Profit (ESP)
Subject: SDS (Statistics and Data Science) / Statistical Inference + Hypothesis Testing  
Name: Abdanur

## 📌 Project Description
This project focuses on **statistical inference and hypothesis testing** using Python.  
I use an **e-commerce sales and profit** dataset to build a research question, write null/alternative hypotheses, choose an appropriate statistical test, calculate the test statistic and p-value, and interpret the result at a significance level of **α = 0.05**.

Original dataset source (Kaggle):
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nalisha/e-commerce-sales-and-profit-analysis-dataset/data

## 💡 Features
- Describe the dataset and define a clear research question
- Write hypotheses in correct statistical form:
  - Null hypothesis (H₀)
  - Alternative hypothesis (H₁)
- Select and justify a suitable statistical test (based on variable types and groups)
- Run hypothesis testing in Python and report:
  - test statistic
  - p-value
  - decision using α = 0.05
- Interpret results in simple words (reject / fail to reject H₀)
- Write a short conclusion and discuss limitations + what can be explored next

## 📦 Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- SciPy (statistical tests)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (optional for supporting plots)

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MnstrsParago/SDS.HypothesisTesting.ESP.git
   cd SDS.HypothesisTesting.ESP
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scipy matplotlib seaborn
   ```

3. Open and run the notebook:
   - `Abdanur_Ayazbek_Task3_Analysis.ipynb`

## 📘 Reflection
This project helped me understand how to make conclusions from data using hypothesis testing, not just describe the dataset.  
I learned how to correctly set up hypotheses, choose an appropriate test, and explain what a p-value means in a real dataset context.  
It also showed the importance of limitations (sample size, assumptions, data quality) when making statistical decisions.
